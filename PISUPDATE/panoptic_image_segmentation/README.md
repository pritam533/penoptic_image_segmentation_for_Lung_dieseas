#  Panoptic Image Segmentation for Lung Disease Detection
This project was developed by students of VIT Bhopal as part of Project Exhibition 2 at VIT Bhopal University, under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

This project uses deep learning (U-Net) to segment lungs and detect lung diseases from X-ray images. It includes a web-based interface where users can upload an X-ray, view segmentation results, and get a downloadable PDF report with predictions.


## Project Objective
To develop an intelligent web-based platform that leverages deep learning (U-Net architecture) for panoptic segmentation and classification of lung diseases (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Lung Opacity) from chest X-ray images. The system provides:

Real-time segmentation output
Disease prediction with severity estimation
AI-generated doctor-style comments
A downloadable PDF report 

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to leverage deep learning for early and accurate detection of lung diseases like COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Lung Opacity through X-ray images using panoptic segmentation techniques. The project combines medical AI, web application development, and report automation to provide a complete diagnostic support system.

## Formats
    - All the images are in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format and resolution are 299*299 pixels.

## Features

- Upload Chest X-ray images (via UI)
- Automatic lung & disease-affected region segmentation using U-Net
- Disease classification and severity estimation
- PDF Report generation (with image, result, and patient info)
- Email report to the patient (optional)
- Manual segmentation feature (optional)
- Full Flask + HTML + JS (AJAX) stack


## Model Info
Architecture: U-Net

Input: Chest X-ray images (typically 256x256 or 512x512)
Output: Segmentation mask (disease regions)
Dataset Used: COVID-19 Radiography Dataset from Kaggle

## Future Improvements
Panoptic segmentation with instance + semantic labeling
More advanced disease classification (multi-label)
Responsive frontend dashboard
Live segmentation feedback

##  ABOUT dataset 

COVID-19 CHEST X-RAY DATABASE

A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. This COVID-19, normal and other lung infection dataset is released in stages. In the first release we have released 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal and 1345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray (CXR) images. In the first update, we have increased the COVID-19 class to 1200 CXR images. In the 2nd update, we have increased the database to 3616 COVID-19 positive cases along with 10,192 Normal, 6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection) and 1345 Viral Pneumonia images and corresponding lung masks. We will continue to update this database as soon as we have new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
